#Zocus and the Big Life Fix

Zocus allows you to wirelessly control the Zoom and Focus of your DSLR Camera Lens, via the Bluetooth enabled [Zocus App](http://www.zocus.co.uk/), on iPad or iPhone (Android coming soon).

The device is useful to any Photograph/Film enthusiast, although the device was originally developed for James Dunn as part of BBC Twoâ€™s series, The Big Life Fix with Simon Reeve. James is passionate about photography, but who also has a condition called [Epidermolysis Bullosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermolysis_bullosa), which makes his skin very sensitive to even slight pressure. This causes James severe pain and considerable frustration when trying to operate fiddly camera buttons or scroll/jog-wheels. 

James wants to master this art and wants full creative control of a professional DSLR camera, to frame and focus the world as he sees it. At the time, James had to verbally describe each of the numerous adjustments on the DSLR to his dad Kenny. Understandably, this was prone to confusion on both of their parts.

Jude was recruited by the producers of the series at Studio Lambert to help James take full creative control of a professional DSLR camera, to frame and focus the world as he sees it work on this project with James. 

The Design Brief was as follows:
Both Focus and Zoom must be controlled button/dial-free.
Although Follow-Focus gear does exist, these only control the low-torque Focus Ring of the Lens, not the Zoom as well. They are also very expensive.
These are also usually controlled (via wires) by a large hand-held dial. It is not possible for James to operate devices like this.
James would also like the solution to work with his tablet/smartphone, via an App.

The solution is the Zocus rig. The electronic parts are widely available and the 3D printed parts could be downloaded and edited to make new designs.

The final design (or should we say, V1.0), was presented to James, and he was able to use this in combination with other off-the-shelf photographic equipment (such as CamRanger to control the Pan and Tilt of the Camera, as well as the settings - all from a tablet computer). 

The Zocus App was developed to control the Zoom and Focus via a Tablet/Smartphone, and was developed with the help of Ross Atkin (bluetooth transmitter) and Akram Hussein (iOS app). James is now able to capture the world as he sees it, with a degree of control he never assumed was possible. He hopes that others enjoy using Zocus, via this Open Source design.
